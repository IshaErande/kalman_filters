# Kalman Filters

This repository provides an implementation of Kalman filters.

## Python Implementation

The `python` folder contains the Kalman filter algorithm in Python, with the following files:

- **Main.py**: Final representation and execution of the Kalman filter.
- **kf.py**: Main module containing the Kalman filter logic.
- **Test_kf.py**: Includes test cases to verify the functionality of the Kalman filter.

## C++ Implementation

The `CPP` folder contains the Kalman filter algorithm implemented in C++. It includes:

- **kalman.cpp**: Contains a Kalman filter class. Ensure that the Eigen library is installed to use this implementation.
